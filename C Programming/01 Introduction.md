# C Programming

+ What is C programming?<br>
It is a programming language by which we can communicate with computer.

+ What is C?<br>
C is a procedural programming language developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in 1972 at AT and T's BELL LABs, USA.

+ Why learning C programming is must?<br>
    + _C is a MID Level Language_-<br>C language is somewhere between Low-level machine understandable assembly languages and High-Level user friendly languages. Being a middle-level language, C reduces the gap between the low-level and high-level languages. It can be used for writing operating systems as well as doing application level programming.
    + _Helps to understand the fundamentals of Computer Theories_-<br>Most of the theories related to computers like Computer Networks, Compiler Designing, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems are based on C programming language and requires a good knowledge of C programming if you are working on them. In the modern high level languages, the machine level details are hidden from the user, so in order to work with CPU cache, memory, network adapters, learning C programming is a must.
    + _Fewer Libraries_-<br>C programming language has fewer libraries in comparison with other high-level languages. So, learning C programming also clears programming concepts to a great extent as you have to write lot of things from scratch. You will not be dependent on the programming language entirely for implementing some basic operations and implementing them on your own will also help you to build your analytical skills.
    + _C is very fast in terms of execution time_-<br>Programs written and compiled in C executes much faster than compared to any other programming language. C programming language is very fast in terms of execution as it does not have any additional processing overheads such as garbage collection or preventing memory leaks etc. The programmer must take care of these things on his own.
    + _Embedded Programming_-<br>C is extensively used in Embedded Programming. Embedded Programming is also referred to as micro-controller programming, where C program is used to control micro-controllers. Microcontrollers and embedded programming is widely used in auto-motives, Robotics, Hardwares etc.
